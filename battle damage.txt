Hm... yesterday quite neat idea came to me.
When fighting with Sajuuk I noticed odd thing - the holes after bombs tend to disappear quite fast... too fast.
So I would like to ask you guys if you don't know how to extend this time? Something like 10xnormal would be great, as would make battles far more cool-looking, while still realistic (ships fix themselves so the holes should dissappear too) ~Sky_walker
