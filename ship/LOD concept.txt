LOD distance increase:

Fighters/corvettes - no change
Frigates - x2
Destroyers up - x4

How to?
  increase value of NewShipType.upLOD and NewShipType.downLOD
  eg:
   NewShipType.upLOD = 2000
   NewShipType.upLOD = 2500
   NewShipType.downLOD = 2015
   NewShipType.downLOD = 2515
  should be changed to:
   NewShipType.upLOD = 4000
   NewShipType.upLOD = 5000
   NewShipType.downLOD = 4030
   NewShipType.downLOD = 5030



ps. How about increasing view distance (not LODs, but how far camera see)? Good idea? How to make it?

I agree with the notion of increasing LOD distances, also add the motherships to the list.  I'll start testing out these values when I get a chance with the vgr stuff.

Disagree with increasing view distance, would upset some gameplay issues I think.
- Hm... well... could make gameplay somewhat easier... well... ok, we may resign from increased view distance. ~Sky_walker
