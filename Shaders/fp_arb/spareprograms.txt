shipbasewithbadgepass.fp
* could not impliment badges per-pixel due to mask and badge textures not being passed to the fragment_program/badgelight.st shader. Code removed for now
.
megalithglowpass.fp
* code now redundant, relavent code is already in ship.fp

badge.fp
* still used, but could be replaced with ship.fp as badges have been disabled. See comment for shipbasewithbadgepass.fp.
