^ adamstrange shown that explosions for subsystems were already in HW2, only time for them was set to 0, so we don't see exploding sybsystems in game.
What would you guys say for adding to our mod exploding subsystems?
Basicly all we would do would be changing { "animtime", "0", } to some reasonable time.
On the other hand it should be tested if this doesn't intefrer with saved games, if so then I think we shouldn't add it. If it doesn't than it would be cool feature to include.
